  "body": "When I opened the document to write this, I had to pause to remember what year it was. Life has been a blur lately. This is due to jetlag, due to the sheer amount of things going on, and itâ€™s shaped the past year a lot.\n\nPersonally, this year has brought some great life changes. We added Beam to our little family. [If you read last yearâ€™s post](https://medium.com/@sarah_edo/feeling-happy-at-the-end-of-the-world-e3a9dab624bb), youâ€™ll know about my dog Sudo. Sheâ€™s a wise philosopher and mighty hunter. Beam, on the other hand, is a bit of a gremlin dumpling. He steals your stuff, he honks like a goose, heâ€™s always destroying something. But heâ€™s also the most affectionate and sweet little guy. He gets away with everything because of his face.\n\n![beam](/images/uploads/beam.jpg \"beam\")\n\nI also got married to [Dizzy](https://twitter.com/dizzyd). This is great news for me because heâ€™s the best human Iâ€™ve ever met and way too good for me (shh, donâ€™t tell him). Iâ€™m lucky to be with him. He also has the best kids. Stepmotherhood is a great gig for someone like me who never wanted kids of their own. I zip straight from motherhood to grandmotherhood- we play hide and seek, I spoil them, and we have a really great time together. I never thought I would be content to hang out with kids instead of going to bar with friends on a Friday night- turns out these tiny humans are just as entertaining as drunk people, though thereâ€™s still the chance youâ€™ll be barfed on.\n\n![mawwage](/images/uploads/mawwage.jpg \"mawwage\")\n\nIn terms of community work, I kicked it up a notch this year. I made quite a few public GitHub repos, 20 to be specific, gathering **10,028 stars in total**. These stats arenâ€™t really something to over-index on, but what they do allow me to see is whether people are using the projects and appreciate the time investment.\n\nMy favorite among those being:\n\n* [Array Explorer](https://github.com/sdras/array-explorer)\n* [Object Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/object-explorer/)\n* [Project Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/project-explorer-site/) (really gotta think of better names for these)\n* [Page Transitions Travelapp](https://github.com/sdras/page-transitions-travelapp)\n* [Sample Vue Shop](https://github.com/sdras/sample-vue-shop)\n* [Awesome Actions](https://github.com/sdras/awesome-actions)\n\nI made some VS Code extensions:\n\n* [Vue VS Code Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras)\n* [Vue Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-extensionpack&WT.mc_id=twitter-social-sdras)\n* Most notable, [Night Owl Theme](https://aka.ms/nightowl) is used in a lot of places- it was ported 16 times to other platforms, and has **183K downloads** so far.\n\nI wrote **19 posts**, most were on CSS-Tricks, 10 of which were about Vue.js, gathering roughly **half a million views** altogether (483K to be exact). It still astounds me that writing words on these here internets can reach so many people. My favorite of these are:\n\n* [Introducing GitHub Actions](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-github-actions/)\n* [Native-like Page Transitions on the Web](https://css-tricks.com/native-like-animations-for-page-transitions-on-the-web/)\n* [Understanding the Almighty Reducer](<Understanding the Almighty Reducer>)\n\nAs for Vue core, Iâ€™ve been working along on the [Cookbook](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/) with great contributions from the community. Honestly I havenâ€™t been able to devote enough time to it lately as I would like, having been on the road and working. I have to turn my attention to it soon to revamp and improve it for [Vue 3 coming out next year](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/plans-for-the-next-iteration-of-vue-js-777ffea6fabf). Thereâ€™s also some other work Iâ€™m gonna get to work on that I hope will be _super dope_, but I canâ€™t tell you about that quite yet ðŸ¤«\n\n![vue core in japan](/images/uploads/japan.jpg \"vue core in japan\")\n\n_This photo is of some, not all, of the Vue core team in Japan_\n\nI spoke **30** times in **13** different countries including Iceland, Japan, Poland, the UK, and Switzerland. This is probably the most privileged part of my life, and I appreciate this opportunity so much. It wasnâ€™t even that long ago that I was being rejected from everything, so being invited to these is a real honor.\n\nIt was so fun, but the last few years were also very conference-heavy so I think I really gotta slow it down in the future and find a more sane pace. My goal for this year was to keep it at a dozen and clearly I missed that goal (I love travel). My 12 year old stepdaughter has put herself in charge of my calendar for next year. I have 100% more faith in her than me so thatâ€™s the plan. Iâ€™d like to make space for others to have that kind of journey if they want it, too.\n\nA record of some of my [slide decks are here](https://noti.st/sdras). My favorite talk of the year was probably this one from JS Conf Iceland:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2iCyulbnus\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nI taught a few workshops, a bunch of Vue ones, some [Web Animation Workshops with Val Head](https://webanimationworkshops.com/), and more recently, [Design for Developers](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/design-for-devs/) and [SVG Animations](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/svg-animation/) for Frontend Masters. Design for Developers is the first workshop Iâ€™ve created solely because people asked me to.\n\nThe most meaningful work of this year was getting to co-organize [Concatenate Conf](https://concatenate.io/) with Christian Nwamba, and Brian Holt, with Prosper Otemuyiwa as our MC. Next year the planning committee has grown to include Gift Egwuenu, who spoke at this yearâ€™s event, and Simona Cotin. The concept for this conference is a free conference for Nigerians- due to travel and monetary restrictions, sometimes they are denied access to international developer events, so we wanted to bring the conference there. [Christian wrote an amazing thread about it here](https://twitter.com/codebeast/status/1018828622134743040).\n\n**We filled up 1000 slots in 24 hours!** We had speakers both local and remote and the whole thing was livestreamed. We trended #1 on twitter in Nigeria for almost 4 days. Some businesses in the area declared it a holiday and let people off of work to attend. Collaborating with Christian on this has been a dream- heâ€™s one of the most thoughtful, hardworking, and intelligent people Iâ€™ve ever had the opportunity to work with, and if you donâ€™t follow him, youâ€™re missing out.\n\n![](/images/uploads/concatenate.jpg)\n\nWeâ€™re opening sponsorships to this event for October 2019 soon, so if youâ€™re a company and interested in supporting, please reach out! info@concatenate.io. Weâ€™re also creating an open collective soon to collect donations from individuals. Weâ€™re hoping to fly speakers out next year so we can have an even more hands-on event this time!\n\nI was promoted at Microsoft, Iâ€™m now **Lead of Emerging Markets**, Cloud Developer Advocates. Some of what weâ€™re doing in this group is supporting communities like Concatenate Conf did, and thatâ€™s so exciting.\n\nAll in all, itâ€™s been pretty busy! Iâ€™m actually kind of hoping to slow down a bit next year, Iâ€™ve been going pretty hard for a while now and I want to find a better balance. Because Iâ€™m an introvert, the OSS work where I sit at home and code all day feels really replenishing while going to speak at conferences takes it out of me completely. Iâ€™m definitely planning on maximizing the ways I can contribute from my pajamas. Because thatâ€™s the dream, right? Thatâ€™s my dream, anyways. ðŸš«ðŸ‘–",
